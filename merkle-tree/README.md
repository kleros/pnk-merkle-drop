# Merkle Tree

Merkle Tree implementation, shamelessly adapted from [`@openzeppelin/contracts`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) test utils.

## Installation

Install this package along with its peer dependencies:

```bash
yarn add @kleros/merkle-tree ethereumjs-util@^7.0.0 "web3@>=1.3.1 <1.4"
# npm install --save @kleros/merkle-tree ethereumjs-util@^7.0.0 "web3@>=1.3.1 <1.4"
```

**IMPORTANT**: `web3` has a history of not properly following semver. Please make sure to install a version explicitly supported.
